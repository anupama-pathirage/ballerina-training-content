# Ballerina GraphQL - Banking application sample

The data source to the GraphQL server can be anything, such as a database, API, or service that holds data. Also, GraphQL can interact with any combination of data sources. Let's see how we can implement a GraphQL server using the Ballerina language to expose data in the MySQL database in this use case.

The MySQL database holds data about a bank, and it has account details and employee details in two tables. Each account has an attached bank employee. So, the purpose of this application is to retrieve various data, such as
* details of all accounts
* details of a specific account
* accounts under each bank employee

## Repo Details 

[Level 0](https://github.com/anupama-pathirage/ballerina-training-content/tree/graphql-level0/graphql-bank) - Returning hard coded data set.

[Level 1](https://github.com/anupama-pathirage/ballerina-training-content/tree/graphql-level1/graphql-bank) - Connect to DB and get data from DB (With record as output object)

[Level 2](https://github.com/anupama-pathirage/ballerina-training-content/tree/graphql-level2/graphql-bank) - Add filtering with input parameters for objects (With record as output object)

[Level 3](https://github.com/anupama-pathirage/ballerina-training-content/tree/graphql-level3/graphql-bank) - Add filtering with input parameters for fields of the object (With service as output object)

[Level 4](https://github.com/anupama-pathirage/ballerina-training-content/tree/graphql-level4/graphql-bank) - Generate dynamic queries based on the fields requested in the query

## Set up the Database

1. If you are using docker :

2. If you are using MySQL DB instance
Create the sample MySQL database and populate data with the [data.sql](data.sql) script as follows.
    ```
    mysql -u root -p < /path/to/db.sql

    ```
## Run the code

Execute `bal run` command  within the `graphql-bank` project folder.


## Test the service

To call the GraphQL server, we need to use a client. There are few options to do that.

1. Use the Ballerina GraphQL [Try it tool](https://ballerina.io/learn/vs-code-extension/try-the-services/try-graphql-services/).
2. Use the [built-in GraphiQL client](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/graphql-graphiql/) in Ballerina.
3. With [curl](https://curl.se/) by sending an HTTP POST request to the endpoint, passing the GraphQL query as the query field in a JSON payload.

For all the requests, the endpoint is  : http://localhost:9094/bank

### Sample Request 1:  Get the details of all the accounts
